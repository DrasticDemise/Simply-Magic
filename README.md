# Simply-Magic
Simply Magic aims to fill the gaps in user understanding of magic-based mods by providing a supplementary quest book that sets milestones and points of progression for the player.

If you wish to contribute to this mod pack through quest additions, corrections, clarifications, or config changes, make an issue with the tag [Proposal] and summarize your proposed change. Any issues marked with To-Do are approved for changes. If you decide to make a contribution to an approved task, simply make a pull request with a summary and explanation of what you changed or added, and if it resolves the issue entirely.
